## Oh Jello!

A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1][2] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

This is my version of `Hello, World!`.  If you have ever personally talked with me I always use `jello` instead of `hello`.  With that being said...

```python
    print("Jello, World! My First Blog Post!")
```
